This was created as my final project for IT 231: Software Engineering and Application Development at South Hills School of Business and Technology in 2022.

The goal of this project was to gain experience in the Software Development Lifecycle by beginning with a high level design, deciding how to implement desired effects, and putting those choices into practice.

The outcome of this project was a website design that could theoretically be utilized as a personal website to showcase my personal and professional interests.
